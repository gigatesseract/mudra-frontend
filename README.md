### The problem Mudra solves    

A world where interactive is dominated by touch, we provide a much efficient way to interact with the products around you. Introducing Mudra, an EMG, vision-based gesture recognition assistant, that uses hand gestures to help interact with gadgets around you! With Mudra, people can interact with gadgets quickly and also, help the disabled mingle and interact freely with others. Mudra's gesture-to-voice module allows a layman to communicate with a blind or a mute person, as the person's hand gestures are translated in real-time and displayed to the end-user. Not only that, Mudra allows a user to create his own custom gesture and map it to anything he wants, as we believe that people should not be restricted to fixed gestures and signs. Mudra also allows a person to interact with gadgets easily, like playing and pausing music with a gesture. This provides for effective communicative ways then touch.
